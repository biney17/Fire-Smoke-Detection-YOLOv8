## 🔥 Fire & Smoke Detection using YOLOv8 | Computer Vision Internship Project

I’m proud to share my **Fire & Smoke Detection project**, developed as part of my **internship at Aitronix**, under the supervision of **Mr. Mina Nabil**.

This project focuses on applying **Computer Vision and Deep Learning** to detect **fire and smoke in images and videos**, contributing to **early warning systems** and **safety monitoring solutions**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

* **Model**: YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
* **Task**: Fire & Smoke Detection
* **Tools**: Python, Ultralytics YOLOv8, VS Code
* **Training**: 80 epochs on a custom local dataset
* **Inference**: Real-time detection on images and videos with bounding boxes and confidence scores

---

## 📊 Model Performance (Final Results)

* **Precision** ≈ **0.78**
* **Recall** ≈ **0.71**
* **mAP@50** ≈ **0.78**
* **mAP@50–95** ≈ **0.46**

These results demonstrate a strong balance between accuracy and generalization for a safety-critical application.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Real-time **fire and smoke detection**
* Works on **images and video streams**
* Clean and structured training pipeline
* Simple prediction workflow (upload image → get results)

## 🎓 Skills & Experience Gained

* Dataset preparation and annotation for object detection
* Training and fine-tuning YOLOv8 models
* Model evaluation using **Precision, Recall, and mAP**
* Practical experience with **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**
* Working in a **professional internship environment**
